###The Contest-Based Social Network

I first attempted to create this app while finishing my coding bootcamp at [MakerSquare](http://www.makersquare.com), but decided to do it again now because now I am more knowledgeable and able to develop a better product.

The code for the first app lies [here](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/contest).

Both apps have been created completely from scratch, helping myself with tutorials, Stack Overflow, Google, the Ruby and the Rails Docs and of course, a great mix of knowledge and trial and error.
